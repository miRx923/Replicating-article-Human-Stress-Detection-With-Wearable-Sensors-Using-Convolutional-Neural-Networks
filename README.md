# Replicating article: Human Stress Detection With Wearable Sensors Using Convolutional Neural Networks

### You can either 

1. execute <code><b>create_data.py</b></code> script to just create data needed for replication, or
2. execute <code><b>run_all_experiments.py</b></code> to just execute experiments from the paper, assuming you already have the data created, or
3. execute <code><b>main.py</b></code> script to create data and run all the experiments all in one file. This might take about 16+ hours.

### Lengths of execution:
- creating data approximately 3 hours,
- running all experiments (9 experiments) approximately 13,5 hours
